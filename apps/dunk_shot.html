      <h1 class="post_title" style="text-align:center;">Dunk Shot Automation</h1>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://github.com/jstorf2/AutoGames/tree/master/dunkshot">GitHub Repository</a></p>
      <p>
          This is a <b>Python</b> script that I made to automate the playing of a game called Dunk Shot.&nbsp;
          Dunk Shot is a game where you shoot basketballs from one hoop to another.&nbsp; These
          hoops could be moving or standing still.&nbsp; There are also obstacles you have to 
          avoid.&nbsp; Below is a video of the script in action.&nbsp; Below that is a
          description of how the script works.
      </p>
      <div class="showcase_video"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FPjrj6N32yI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
      <h2>Connecting and getting pixel information from phone</h2>
      <p>
          The first thing the script does is connect to an Android phone through a USB connection using
          a Python library called <b>ppadb</b>.&nbsp; This stands for "pure python android debug bridge".&nbsp;
          <b>ppadb</b> contains functions to connect to an Android phone using the <b>adb</b> provided by
          Google.
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="prettyprint">
abd = Client(host="127.0.0.1", port=5037)
devices = abd.devices()

if (len(devices) == 0):
    print("no devices")
else:
    device = devices[0] #Assume first device is the device needed
      </code></pre>
      <p>
          Using the <b>ppadb</b> package the program can take a screenshot of the Android device and store it as
          a png file.&nbsp; The script uses this png and converts it into a numpy array, taking only the needed 
          rows.&nbsp; The numpy array contains pixel information stored in a red green blue opacity format.
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint"><code>
def getPixelInformation():
    #This function takes a device screencap and converts it into a numpy array.  Returning a image that is in (y,x) coordinates.
    # Also known as (height, width)
    
    image = device.screencap()
    with open("game.png", 'wb') as file:
        file.write(image)
        
    image = Image.open('game.png')
    image = np.array(image, dtype=np.uint8)  #convert image into numpy array for easily accessing pixel data. 
                                             # In (y,x) coordinate system instead of (x,y)
    
    image = image[600:2200] #Take only the rows that matter on the screen
    
    return image
      </code></pre>
      <h2>Check if hoop is moving</h2>
      <p>
          The second thing the script does is check if the hoop that the program is going to aim at
          is moving or not.&nbsp; It does that by first getting a numpy array of the pixel information by
          calling the <b>getPixelInformation()</b> function.&nbsp; The script then finds and stores the location
          of the first hoop pixel that it finds.&nbsp; The hoop pixels can be red or gray.&nbsp; It takes 
          another screenshot and repeats the process.&nbsp; The program then checks if the location of the 
          pixels it found matches up.&nbsp; If they do not that means that the hoop moves.
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint"><code>
def findFirstPixelOccurence(rgbImage):
    #This function finds the location of the first occurence of a pixel with a hoop color.

    firstPixelLocation = [0,0]  #This is the pixel location of the first occurence of a hoop color.  These are given in x,y coordinates
    foundPixel = False

    i = 0
    while i < len(rgbImage):  #Loop through length of screen
        if(foundPixel):
            break
    
        for j in range(len(rgbImage[0])):  #Loop through width of screen
            currentPixel = rgbImage[i][j]
            
            if(checkForCorrectColor(currentPixel)):
                #Current pixel is the correct rgb color for the rims on the screen
                firstPixelLocation = [j,i]
                foundPixel = True
                break
                
        i += 8 #This is the number of rows to skip when reading pixels
    
    return firstPixelLocation
    
    
def checkForMovingHoop():
    #Checks if the hoop to aim at is moving.  It does that by taking an image and getting the hoop location.  It then takes another image
    # and compares the new hoop location with the old.  True means the hoop is moving.
    
    #Do first check
    rgbImage = getPixelInformation()
    firstCheckLocation = findFirstPixelOccurence(rgbImage)  #This is the pixel location on the first check.  These are given in x,y coordinates
    
    time.sleep(.3)
    
    #Do second check
    rgbImage = getPixelInformation()
    secondCheckLocation = findFirstPixelOccurence(rgbImage)  #This is the pixel location on the second check.  These are given in x,y coordinates
    
    #Check if hoops are in the same location
    if(firstCheckLocation != secondCheckLocation):
        #Hoop has moved
        return True
    
    #Hoop hasn't moved
    return False
      </code></pre>
      <h2>Finding location of the hoops</h2>
      <p>
        After the program determines whether or not the hoop is moving, it gets the pixel information again
        and then sends it into a function that finds the location of the middle of the hoops.&nbsp; It finds
        these locations by looping through the pixel array and finding every occurence of a hoop pixel (a
        red or gray pixel) and adds up the locations of them.&nbsp; After it finds the hoop pixels it divides 
        these by the number of pixels it found so that it can get the middle(average) pixel location.
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint"><code>

      <h2>Determining shooting method</h2>
      <p>
        Once the script determines the hoop locations the program determines which throw method it will use.  
        There are two throw methods.&nbsp; One in which the ball gets thrown right above the outer edge of the 
        hoop and one where the ball gets throw as high as possible.&nbsp; Both use the <b>4 kinematic equations</b> to
        determine the correct distance to pull back the ball.&nbsp; To use these equations I had to determine
        the acceleration due to gravity.&nbsp; To figure this out I used a program called <b>scrcpy</b> which allows
        me to view my Android screen on my pc.&nbsp; With that and enabling <b>developer tools</b> on my phone I was
        able to run tests to determine the acceleration in pixels/second^2.&nbsp; The first throw method listed 
        works by calculating the initial x and y velocities the ball needs for it's peak to be right above 
        the edge of the hoop.&nbsp; It then uses these velocities to determine the angle that the ball needs to 
        be pulled back at and the distance to pull back the ball.&nbsp; The second method works very similar to 
        the first except that the initial y velocity is set to be the highest possible velocity the ball 
        can achieve.&nbsp; This causes the ball to go as high as possible.&nbsp; (Note: The script doesn't currently
        compensate for the movement of the hoop so the throw during that situation is random to whether it 
        is successful or not).
      </p>

        The final step is to use the pull back distances that were calculated and combine it with a command
